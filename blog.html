                        <p class="card-text">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday announced a new stimulus package of
                            Tk 5,000 crore to give financial assistance to small and medium farmers and help them face
                            the fallout of Covid-19.

                            "Bangladesh Bank will formulate a new refinancing scheme of Tk 5,000 crore to pump running
                            capital into the agricultural sector. We'll create this Tk 5,000 crore stimulus package only
                            for the agricultural sector. We'll disburse money from this fund among farmers at only 5
                            percent interest," she said.

                            The PM came up with the package while delivering her introductory speech in a video
                            conference from the Gono Bhaban with government officials from 16 districts under Khulna and
                            Barishal divisions.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">To deliver increased wheat yield, a combination of fundamental bioscience
                            and applied research will be needed. IWYP will deliver this through a focused program of
                            research to develop new knowledge, models and wheat lines suited to multiple environments
                            ensuring global gains in wheat yields are achieved.

                            IWYP will target six key research areas:

                            Uncovering genetic variation that creates the differences in carbon fixation and
                            partitioning between wheat lines
                            Harnessing genes from wheat and other species through genetic modification to boost carbon
                            capture and fixation to increase biomass production
                            Optimizing wheat development and growth to improve grain yields and harvest index
                            Developing elite wheat lines for use in other breeding programs
                            Building on discoveries in wheat relatives and other species
                            Fostering breakthrough technology development that can transform wheat breeding

                        <p class="card-text">This dream may seem unattainable- but itâ€™s not! With hard work, good
                            planning, and living within your means you can earn easily earn enough money to create that
                            life you want- a life where all of your income comes from your farm and you can quit working
                            for others!

                            The biggest thing to remember when you think about making money farming is to use
                            everything. Use every part of a crop. Every part of an animal. Create multiple income
                            streams so that not all of your eggs are in one basket.

                            No matter how small the income stream may seem, all those little sales can add up to create
                            one full time, livable income!</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Since gaining independence in 1971, Bangladesh has increased its real per
                            capita income by more than 130 per cent and cut poverty by more than half. Yet it remains a
                            low-income country with substantial poverty, inequality and deprivation.

                            Almost one third of the population lives below the poverty line, and poverty is highest in
                            rural areas. Half of all rural children are chronically malnourished and 14 per cent suffer
                            from acute malnutrition.

                            Although agriculture now accounts for less than 20 per cent of gross domestic product, the
                            farm sector still employs about 44 per cent of the labour force. However, the amount of
                            farmland is shrinking as the country urbanizes, and most rural households have little if any
                            cultivable land. Rice, wheat, jute, fruits and vegetables are the main food crops, but
                            farmers lacklack access to critical agricultural inputs such as high-yielding rice seeds.
